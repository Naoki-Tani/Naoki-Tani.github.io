- [General Equilibrium Analysis of Fiscal Transfers in an Aging Society](https://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DP1093.pdf) (with Y. Uemura)
 
    We analyze fiscal transfer policies using a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model given heterogeneous local productivities and amenities, migration of young and elderly population, and inter-regional trade. We confirm that fiscal transfers improve welfare by reducing congestion in urban areas and increasing public services and real wages in rural areas. Contrary to the literature, introducing mobility of elderly population indicates possibility of optimal transfers that enable the central government to accomplish welfare gains without sacrificing national output.
