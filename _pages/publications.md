- [Firms' Internationalization Decisions and Demand Learning](https://www.rieti.go.jp/jp/publications/summary/24020009.html) (with E. Ogawa)

  This study investigates the rationale for firms to establish foreign affiliates without export experience in the affiliate destinations despite facing demand uncertainty. As over half of Japanese firms start their first internationalization process through foreign direct investment (FDI), we attempt to explain this pattern by developing a statistical decision-making model in which firms make decisions about entering foreign markets via FDI or exports under demand uncertainty. Our model incorporates the proximity-concentration tradeoff and the demand-learning mechanism through which firms predict their demand level based on information about the number and average productivity of their neighbors. We analytically show that demand-learning from neighbors affects firms' entry and exit decisions regarding FDI. We provide supporting evidence for the main predictions of the model by using a rich micro-level dataset of Japanese multinational firms.

- [General Equilibrium Analysis of Fiscal Transfers in an Aging Society](https://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DP1093.pdf) (with Y. Uemura)
 
    We analyze fiscal transfer policies using a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model given heterogeneous local productivities and amenities, migration of young and elderly population, and inter-regional trade. We confirm that fiscal transfers improve welfare by reducing congestion in urban areas and increasing public services and real wages in rural areas. Contrary to the literature, introducing mobility of elderly population indicates possibility of optimal transfers that enable the central government to accomplish welfare gains without sacrificing national output. 

- [True Impact of Japan’s Covid State of Emergency on Consumption](https://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DP1092.pdf)
 
    This study examines the effect of the Covid pandemic containment measures on Japan’s consumption, using high-frequency credit card data. Based on the assumption that neighboring municipalities on prefectural borders with different containment policies have an equivalent fear of contagion, this study distinguishes the negative effect of containment measures on consumption from the effect of fear, by employing a synthetic control method. Specifically, it constructs a synthetic control municipality that faces fear equal to that faced by untreated municipalities in the donor pool, and whose post-treatment consumption corresponds to the counterfactual consumption of the treated municipality without containment intervention. Comparing the synthetic control and treated municipalities’ consumption with prefectural borders, allows the identification of the true impact of the containment policies on consumption. These results indicate that, the negative effects of the state of emergency on consumption is much lower than the extreme decline in consumers’ spending.

- [属性別所得の記述的分析 ―属性間の分布差異の可視化と寄与度分解―](https://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DP2502.pdf)

   1989年から2019年までの全国家計構造調査（旧全国消費実態調査）の個票データより23歳から59歳の課税前所得のデータを使用し、政府が対応する様々な属性間格差について、属性別所得分布のパーセンタイルごとの差異に着目した可視化と、属性間格差と属性内格差の寄与度分解を行う。分析の結果、都道府県間や産業間の格差の寄与率は数％程度である一方、非正規雇用者の所得分布が低所得層に大きく偏っており、就業形態間の格差が25％程度と大きな説明力を持つことを示す。更に、就業形態間の格差は40歳以上59歳以下で大きい傾向にあるが、39歳以下の世代でも就業形態間格差の寄与率は他の属性別の寄与率に比べて高水準であることが確認された。
